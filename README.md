# Adventofcode2022

Attempt to solve some of the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles to explore the Elixir programming language.

## How to run the solutions

```bash
# Compile project
mix compile
# To run any of the solution: min run -e ModuleName.solution -- args
mix run -e Day1.solution -- test.txt
```

**Warning**: Exploring the language had a higher priority than code quality, procede with caution!
